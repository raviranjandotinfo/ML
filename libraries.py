# List of machine learning (ML) libraries that I have been using throughout the projects. 

# NumPy :- Using for matrix, large multi-dimensional array and high-level mathematical functions. 
import numpy as np 

# SciPy :- Using for linear algebra, integration and statistics. 
from scipy.misc import imread, imsave, imresize 

# Scikit-learn :- It supports most of the supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. Using for data-mining and data-analysis. 
from sklearn import datasets 
from sklearn import metrics 
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier 
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Theano :- Using it to define, evaluate and optimize mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays. 
import theano 
import theano.tensor as T 

# TensorFlow :- Using it to train and run deep neural networks to develop several AI applications. 
import tensorflow as tf 

# PyTorch :- Used for Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing(NLP). 
import torch

# Pandas :- Used for data extraction, high-level data structures and data analysis. 
import pandas as pd 

# Matplotlib :- Used for graphs and plots for data visualization, histogram, error charts and bar chats.
