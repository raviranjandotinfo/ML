XGBoost is a supervised-learning algorithm used for both classification and regression, also commonly used in ranking problems. It has better handling of overfitting problems and provides results based on sequential based shallow trees.

In these projects I am analyzing the different cryptocurrencies forecasting using XGBoost.
