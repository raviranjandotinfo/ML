The LSTM extends the neural network memory and makes that be able to learn from important experiences. Like computers, LSTM contains information in memory for a long time â€“ and can read, write, and delete when needed. 

In these projects I am analyzing the different cryptocurrencies forecasting using LSTM.

XGBoost is a supervised-learning algorithm used for both classification and regression, also commonly used in ranking problems. It has better handling of overfitting problems and provides results based on sequential based shallow trees.
