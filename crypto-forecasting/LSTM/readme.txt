The LSTM extends the neural network memory and makes that be able to learn from important experiences. Like computers, LSTM contains information in memory for a long time â€“ and can read, write, and delete when needed. 

In these projects I am analyzing the different cryptocurrencies forecasting using LSTM. 

1. Bitcoin forecasting 
code : bitcoin.ipynb  Data source : bitcoin.csv

2. Dogecoin forecasting 
code : doge.ipynb  Data source : doge.csv

3. Ethereum forecasting 
code : ethereum.ipynb  Data source : ethereum.csv
